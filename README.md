I'm an operations specialist at the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP). I'm also part of an interdisciplinary project focused on exploring the quantum properties of materials which could be used for the development of new photo-voltaic cells.

I graduated with a degree in applied physics, with a concentration in computational physics, from UC Santa Cruz.
